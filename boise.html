                <h2>City History</h2>
                <p>The history of Boise stretches back to the 1860’s when it was founded as an early town and trading settlement after gold was found 
                    nearby during the gold rush. In 1864 Boise was officially named the capital of Idaho which solidified its importance and as a major 
                    town in Idaho. After the Gold Rush ended many around the city began to farm the land which begun the agricultural industry that still 
                    exists around the city. Other industries such as such as lumber manufacturing also began to pop up around the city during this period. 
                    Once Idaho joined the United States Boise continued to remain as the state capital and still is today. Today Boise is known for it’s 
                    outdoor recreational activities and the surrounding agricultural industry. </p>
