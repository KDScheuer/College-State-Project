                    <p>The Idaho Falls Riverwalk is a trail along the snake river with scenic views. It has many parks and different landscapes 
                        as you explore the trail, including art installations and views of waterfalls. This is a popular tourist destination in 
                        the city for this reason. You can also set up a picnic in the parks or bike these trails. This is also a good spot to 
                        enter the river if you want to go tubing or kayaking.

                    <p>Another popular destination of both tourists and locals is the Idaho Falls Zoo at Tautphaus Park. The zoo has many different 
                        animals and exhibits. There are also interactive exhibits that you can participate in to get a closer look at the animals. 
                        This is a perfect day activity as the zoo is not too small or too large. The experience is family friendly and great if you 
                        have kids.

                <h2>City History</h2>
                <p>Idaho Falls is known for its closely tied history to early settlements and railroads. It was originally inhabited by the Shoshone-Bannock 
                    Native Americans. It started off being called Eagle Rock when it was initially founded as a ferry site and transportation hub. Later in 
                    the 1800â€™s a railroad was built through the town which played a critical role in its ability to solidify itself as an important city. 
                    Around the time the railroad was built the city was renamed to Idaho Falls. After World War 2 the Idaho National Laboratory was founded 
                    near the city and has acted as a major influence on the city since then.</p>
